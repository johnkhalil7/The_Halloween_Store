    <p> I started this web site because Halloween has always been my favorite holiday. But during the last year, I started selling my favorite Halloween products, and they've become quite a hit. </p>
    <p> If you click on the Personal link, you can browse my favorite Halloween pictures, stories, and films. And if you join my email list, I will keep you up-to-date on all things Halloween. </p>
