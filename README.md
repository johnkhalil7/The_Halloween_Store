# The_Halloween_Store
Simple project containing 3 parts with each part building on top of the last for CIS-435 class

This is a simple project for CIS-435 to get a feel for HTML and CSS
Hopefully this little assignment I was given can also help those being introduced to the material without overwhelming them with
complicated style and html methods

Part 1:
Website containing only HTML elements, will look extremely bare bones

Part 2:
The same website but with simple CSS features to make the site a little less bare

Part 3:
The same website but with even more CSS added to help make the site look decent without using niche styles
